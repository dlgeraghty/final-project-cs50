# These are my courses
I have always been hungry to learn and learn, different topics, such as:  
- _Technology_: This is the one I do the most, as it is part of my job and education and I have to be continuously training
- _Languages_: I do find beauty in learning new languages, and I think it makes my brain work in a different way than what it's used to
- _Economy_: I am very interested in learning about how money works, how the big players manage it and hopefully I can take steps in the right direction

In this page, you will find different courses that I have passed on this topics, most of them are from Udemy but others not.  
I hope that by seeing the courses that I have taken, you can get a better idea of myself.  
Please also note that this page has been developed with a framework that I am developing, you can see it over at [my github](https://github.com/dlgeraghty/final-project-cs50)
