# AWS Certified Developer Associate
This course has the goal to prepare you for an AWS certification and so covers almost every product that Amazon has to offer, covering the necessary information to understand each module and pass the exam. Unfortunately I didn't prepare the exam well enough to actually do the oficial one.
