# hello cs50
This is my final project!
It consists of a very simple yet powerful static site generator!

## What is a static site generator
A static site generator grabs files written is some _non-code_ format and converts them to html files that can be served with a simple file-browser  
A static site generator does **not generate a backend**  
In this case, it grabs the input from a markdown file and spits out a .html file with a template to make it look good and with the content of the .md file  
The templating part, is working with jinja2 and the markdown-\>html part is working with Marko, both are python libraries that I had to learn how to use  
Actually they were pretty easy and turned out easy to use :)  
although it took a lot of work to get it just like I wanted it  
this is a live test with the menu working  :)
