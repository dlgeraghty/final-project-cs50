# STATIC SITE GENERATOR
#### Video Demo: https://youtu.be/VO1nb8HD-9U
#### Description: 
This project written in python is a simple tool that will convert markdown files into html, creating a nice website :).  

**Motivation**
I have always wanted a middleground between writing html myself and a full cms like wordpress. I have used these two systems in the past but the first is not very good for scalability and the second one always presents the challenge of maintaining a wordpress instance and fighting with templates to get them to do what you want, it is very heavy duty and "easy" for my taste.   
I then discovered some existing static site generators but unfortunately they didn't work very well for me, so I decided to write one that would just suit my needs and no more, that could be extended easily and customized.

**Architecture**
This project in itself only consists of a python file, a html file and a db file, that is all you need.  
Of course, there is more to it than just this:
1. The python file app.py, contains the code for the application naturally and will be explained further in the document
2. The db file will be generated by the app.py file, it is a simple database that will hold some "metadata" needed for our app to work smoother, described in more detail below.
3. The template, currently located in templates/base.html, (although it can be parametrized easily) will be the html template in which the code will be inserted
4. The markdown\_files directory contains the markdown files that the application will take as input
5. The html directory contains the html files that result as output of the application, and will later be served with any file/web server

**Libraries used**
1. [Marko](https://youtu.be/VO1nb8HD-9U): this one helps me convert the files from .md to .html syntax 
2. [jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/): Now, the html produced by marko is not "plain", it will use a html template to make it nicer :). I have personally chosen the [cover template](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/examples/cover/) from bootstrap to be the template here for simplicity and I have retrieved the html, css code from the template and included very basic blocks to make it work. _Please note that support for several templates can bee added very easily and probably will be done soon_
3. [sqlite3](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html): this is the interface I have chosen for a little db, instead of the one provided by cs50.

> it was challenging to learn new libraries, each of them have their singularities but the documentation was overall very helpful. I only struggled a little bit with the sqlite3 lib.
