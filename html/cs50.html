<p>This is my final project!
It consists of a very simple yet powerful static site generator!</p>
<h2>What is a static site generator</h2>
<p>A static site generator grabs files written is some <em>non-code</em> format and converts them to html files that can be served with a simple file-browser<br />
A static site generator does <strong>not generate a backend</strong><br />
In this case, it grabs the input from a markdown file and spits out a .html file with a template to make it look good and with the content of the .md file<br />
The templating part, is working with jinja2 and the markdown-&gt;html part is working with Marko, both are python libraries that I had to learn how to use<br />
Actually they were pretty easy and turned out easy to use :)<br />
although it took a lot of work to get it just like I wanted it<br />
this is a live test with the menu working  :)</p>
